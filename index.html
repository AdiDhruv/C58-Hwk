            <h1>Hi my favorite hobby is to play sports</h1>
            <p>My favorite sport is either cricket or football. 
                I love playing sports because they are a good way of getting exercise and do not involve a screen.
                I specifically love cricket and football (American football) because they are team sports and are a good way to make friends.
                Whenever I finish my online school, I take a break from the screen and go outside and play sports with my friends.
                Playing sports always helps me relieve some stress and is a great source of enjoyment.
